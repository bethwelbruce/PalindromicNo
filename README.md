# PalindromicNo
A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The smallest 6 digit palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers is 101101=143*707.Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers which is less than N.Input Format

First line contains T that denotes the number of test cases. This is followed by T  lines, each containing an integer, N.Constraints

1<=T<=100     ,    101101<N<1000000 .Output Format

Print the required answer for each test case in a new line.
